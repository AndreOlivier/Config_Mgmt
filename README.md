•	making sure that any Changes to CIs in scope are recorded as soon as possible
•	providing all Cybernest Service Management areas with accurate information regarding the current configurations with their physical and functional specifications
•	Verifying that the actual state of the IT Infrastructure (hosted and/or supported by Cybernest) corresponds with the authorised configuration records and data.


2.3	Assumptions and Pre-requisites

It is assumed that the reader of this document has an understanding of:

o	Electronic Audits (Other Repositories): Where CIs are maintained in other official repositories, such as E-Dox and the TGIT SLM tool, a data extract from the repository will be compared to the CMDB on the relevant set of CIs (including attributes and relationships listed)

o	Electronic Audits (CI Owner verification): CI owners will receive the full set of CI records that they are responsible for, with the current state of the CI in terms of attributes and relationships, to verify

•	Audit Schedule:
Audits will be conducted as per the following audit schedule:

o	Telkom End User Devices
o	Telkom Desktop Software
•	Configuration Management will not be conducting audits on Customer End User Devices (external to Telkom) as these fall outside the scope of Configuration Management Control


Reason for Policy
To ensure that audits are performed to verify CMDB information against the actual infrastructure.

Scope of Policy
•	All Configuration Items within the CMDB scope (Section 3.1)
•	CI Owners
 
3.12	Software Licence Management Policy

Policy Statement
Software licenses will be tracked and managed through configuration item relationships established on the CMDB. The following software relationships are currently managed on the CMDB:
•	Desktop Software and Telkom End User Device
•	Operating System and Managed Server
•	Database Management Software and Managed Server

As per the CMDB Growth and Development Policy (Section 3.3) management of software licenses will extend to Management Software and Applications in future.

Reason for Policy
To ensure that Software Licence Management gets addressed and to manage expectations surrounding Software Licence Management.

Scope of Policy
•	Hardware, Software and End User Device configuration items
•	All internal Cybernest staff

•	Hardware, Software and End User Device configuration items
•	All internal Cybernest staff
 
3.14	Definitive Media Library Policy

Definitive and approved versions of software, software licenses and SMS documentation are stored in respective Definitive Media Libraries (DMLs). DMLs currently managed on the CMDB are:
•	Desktop Software DML: DFS (Electronic DML) (\\telkom.co.za\telkom\software)
•	TGIT Application DML: AllFusion Harvest Change Manager (Electronic DML)
•	SMS Documentation DML: E-Dox (Electronic DML) (http://www.webfarm.telkom.co.za/Bookshelf_II/)
•	Microsoft Licenses and Software DML: Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) (Electronic DML): https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx

Approved versions of desktop software will only be booked into or out of the DML via an approved RFC (Change Order on CA Service Desk). Configuration Management will maintain the relationship between the desktop software CI and the respective DML CI on the CMDB through an attribute on the desktop software CI (desktop software relationships are only supported with EUDs in CA Service Desk).

AllFusion Harvest Change Manager is used within TGIT for the software configuration management of the majority of TGIT applications, where proprietary software libraries are not available. Application software may only be booked into the AllFusion Harvest production environment through an approved RFC (Change Order on CA Service Desk). Configuration Management will maintain the relationship between the Software CI and the respective DML CI on the CMDB.

SMS Documentation is managed and controlled through the Documentation Management Process (ITSD-OSS-000009) and updated on the CMDB via a Standard Change. Configuration Management will maintain the relationship between the Documentation CI and the respective DML CI on the CMDB.

Software Licenses are managed and controlled through the software asset management process (ITSD-090519). Cybernest SME’s access the master copies of licensed software from various vendor licensing sites (such as the Microsoft Volume Licensing Service Center). License allocation is managed on the CMDB as per the Software License Management Policy (Section 3.12).


Reason for Policy
To manage the definitive and approved versions of software in the environment, and to protect the integrity of the live environment.

Scope of Policy
•	Software configuration items
•	Documentation configuration items
•	DML configuration items
•	All internal Cybernest staff
